[![Logo](./images/logo.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MohithShrivastava.dx-code-companion)

**Note that this is not official from Salesforce. I created this extension to help my own development workflow for more easily modifying salesforce profile metadata files.**

Provides ability to add, edit, and remove Apex Class, Visualforce Page, Object, and Field metadata from salesforce profiles within an SFDX project structure. This extension requires users to have SalesforceDX CLI and also profile-modifier-plugin(run **sfdx plugins:install profile-modifier-plugin**) for SalesforceDX CLI.

# Requirements

This vscode extension works only once you have installed Salesforce CLI and a profile-modifier-plugin(run **sfdx plugins:install profile-modifier-plugin** on your terminal) that has api for all the commands this extension leverages.

1. Install SalesforceDX CLI from https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli based on your operating system.
2. Install profile-modifier-plugin using the command `sfdx plugins:install profile-modifier-plugin`.Note if you have already then make sure to update to latest always using `sfdx plugins:update`
3. VScode version 1.30 and beyond
4. Salesforce official plugin provides great syntax and language support.Highly recommend to install (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)
5. You have project workspace set up and have sfdx-project.json file in the root folder. 
6. Extension activation is shown in footer with a rocket symbol. Once extension is active authorize the project if you havent and enjoy faster deploys
